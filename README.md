Calling All Super Heroes
========

An app to support do-gooding Super Heroes to offer their free time in service of their communities.  

`Why let a good super power go to waste?`

*Whatapalaver's Rationale* 
----- 
I would like to demonstrate that I can rapidly pick up new technology and run with it. The plan is for this app to be based on API technology (as yet I am undecided whether to stick to RESTful routes or try something new and exciting like GraphQL), run on a Node.js backend with a React Native frontend so our Super Heroes can use their iPhones - or even Android if they are that way inclined.
